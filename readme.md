# StrawDB - A Simple In-Memory Database

## Overview

StrawDB is a basic in-memory database implemented using a B-tree data structure. It supports essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and is built using Python and Flask. This project serves as a foundational example of how a database can be created and manipulated through a RESTful API.

## Features

- **In-Memory Storage**: Uses a B-tree for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity by validating input records.
- **Flask Integration**: Provides a RESTful API for interacting with the database.

## Data Storage

All data will be stored in the `strawdb.bin` file located in the `data` folder.

## Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install Flask
```
